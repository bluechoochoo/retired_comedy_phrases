# Retired Comedy Phrases

What's a retired comedy phrase? A phrase or joke that isn't necessarily innately unfunny (though it could be), it's more likely a phrase that's worn out its welcome, or has been abused by forced usage, and ruined for everybody.

Example entries:
* I'm a hot mess!
* I think we're done here.
* va-jay-jay

Got it?

This is a dataset of retired comedy phrases, originally transcribed from a [Workaholics writers room tweeted photo](https://twitter.com/John_Quaintance/status/799751549610168320), and later appended to with reader suggestions, mostly via Twitter.
(It regularly gets new additions, coz that's how culture works. Gotta keep it moving.)

This dataset is in csv format. It's Excel-friendly, Google spreadsheet-friendly, programming/scripting-friendly.

If you're none of those things, and just interested in pointing and laughing at worn-out catchphrases, you probably want to check out the same info in a different form:
