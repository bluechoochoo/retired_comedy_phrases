# Retired Comedy Phrases
This is a csv (Excel friendly, Google spreadsheet friendly, programming/scripting friendly) dataset of retired comedy phrases, originally based off tweeted photo from Workaholics writers room, and then edited with suggestions, mostly via Twitter.

It's also available in live spreadsheet here. (If you're just a human who wandered here and are confused, go to the spreadsheet. It's human-readable):
