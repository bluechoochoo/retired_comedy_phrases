# Retired Comedy Phrases

What's a retired comedy phrase? It's a phrase or joke that isn't necessarily innately unfunny (though it could be), it's more likely a phrase that's worn out its welcome, or has been abused by forced usage, and ruined for everybody.

Example entries:
* I'm a hot mess!
* I think we're done here.
* va-jay-jay

Got it?

This dataset was originally transcribed from a [Workaholics writers room tweeted photo](https://twitter.com/John_Quaintance/status/799751549610168320), and later appended to with reader suggestions, mostly via Twitter.
(It regularly gets new additions, coz that's how culture works. Gotta keep it moving.)

This dataset is in csv format. It's Excel-friendly, Google spreadsheet-friendly, programming/scripting-friendly.

If you're none of those things, and just interested in pointing and laughing at worn-out catchphrases, you probably want to check out the same info in a different form:

### This is a Casual Spreadsheets resource. ###

Casual Spreadsheets is a subscription service (free and paid) of a bunch of spreadsheets and notebooks tracking random junk in social media and entertainment.

Most data in Casual Spreadsheets is public/freely available. Grabbing a paid subscription gets you automatic updates to everything in your Google Drive. It also gives you more permissions (like export/save) to all the spreadsheets/notebooks.

* You can follow [@casualsheets](https://twitter.com/casualsheets) on Twitter. 
It's a mess!

* If you're looking for a more traditional relationsip, you can subscribe to [Casual Spreadsheet Sufferers](http://tumblr.us5.list-manage1.com/subscribe?u=1b2b06846532c16ea2e952190&id=91a6a2f01f), the free mailing list with updates about showbiz and social media spreadsheets.
* If you want to take this relationship to the next level even though we just met, you can buy a [paid subscription](http://breakroom.casualspreadsheets.com/gimme_subscribe_shut_up_take_my_money.html), but I think you're moving pretty fast.
